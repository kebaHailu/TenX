# Data Analysis Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that provide detailed data analysis for the Weather & Solar Dashboard project. Each notebook focuses on a specific aspect of the data analysis process, including correlation analysis, data cleaning, data quality checks, histograms, bubble charts, summary statistics, time series analysis, wind analysis, and temperature analysis.

## Notebooks

- **Correlation_analysis.ipynb**: This notebook explores the relationships between different weather and solar parameters using correlation analysis. It helps in understanding how different variables are related to each other.

- **Data_cleaning.ipynb**: This notebook focuses on cleaning the raw data to ensure it is ready for analysis. It includes steps such as handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing outliers.

- **Data_quality_check.ipynb**: This notebook performs various data quality checks to verify the integrity and quality of the data. It includes checks for missing values, duplicate records, and consistency of data.

- **Histograms_and_bubble_chart.ipynb**: This notebook provides visualizations of data distributions and relationships using histograms and bubble charts. These visualizations help in understanding the distribution and correlation of different variables.

- **Summary_statistics.ipynb**: This notebook provides comprehensive summary statistics of the data. It includes measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles for different variables.

- **Time_series_analysis.ipynb**: This notebook analyzes trends and patterns over time using time series analysis. It helps in understanding how different variables change over time and identifying any seasonal patterns.

- **Wind_and_temp_analysis.ipynb**: This notebook provides a detailed examination of wind speed, direction, and temperature data. It includes visualizations and analysis of wind patterns and temperature variations.

Each notebook is designed to be self-contained and provides detailed explanations and code for performing the respective analysis. These notebooks serve as a valuable resource for understanding and analyzing the weather and solar data used in the dashboard.
